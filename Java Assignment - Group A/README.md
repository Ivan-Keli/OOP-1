# Java OOP: Interface, Abstract Class, and Concrete Class

## Introduction
This Java program demonstrates the fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles of **Interfaces, Abstract Classes, and Concrete Classes** using a technology-based example.

## Key Concepts
1. **Interface (`Technology`)**:
   - Defines general behaviors (`powerOn()` and `powerOff()`) that all technological devices should implement.
   - Ensures consistency across different device types.

2. **Abstract Class (`Device`)**:
   - Represents a generic device with a `brand` attribute.
   - Provides a concrete method `displayBrand()` and an abstract method `specifications()`.
   - Cannot be instantiated directly.

3. **Concrete Class (`Laptop`)**:
   - A specific implementation of a `Device` that provides full method definitions.
   - Implements all abstract methods and functionalities.
   - Can be instantiated and used in a real-world program.
