# Java OOP: Interface, Abstract Class, and Concrete Class

## Introduction
This Java program explores **Interfaces, Abstract Classes, and Concrete Classes** in a technology-based context, making it easier to grasp these fundamental principles.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Interface (**Technology**)
- Defines shared behaviors (`powerOn()` and `powerOff()`) that all technological devices must implement.  
- Ensures consistency across different device types, similar to a universal standard.

### 2. Abstract Class (**Device**)
- Represents a general category of devices, containing a `brand` attribute.  
- Includes a concrete method (`displayBrand()`) and an abstract method (`specifications()`).  
- Cannot be instantiated on its ownâ€”it serves as a blueprint for more specific devices.

### 3. Concrete Class (**Laptop**)
- A specialized implementation of `Device` that provides full method definitions.  
- Implements all abstract methods and functionalities.  
- Can be instantiated and used in real-world applications, just like an actual laptop you can buy and use.
